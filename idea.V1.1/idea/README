RESTRICTIONS FOR V1.1
=====================

UNIX:         No restrictions.

MS-DOS:       MS-DOS pipes (|) can not be used to concatenate several user 
              commands 'idea'. The pipes are treated as a text-streams and not 
              as a binary-streams. Therefore they can not transmit encrypted 
              data.

VMS:          VMS translates all upper-case letters given on the command-line 
              to lower-case letters. Therefore the options 'K' and 'H' are not 
              accessible. Note that also key-strings are mapped to there 
              lower-case representation.


FILES ON DISKETTE
=================

idea.c        implementation of IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)
idea.h        interface to 'idea.c'
idea_cmd.c    implementation of user command 'idea' (for UNIX, MS-DOS, VMS, ..)
Makefile      describes, how to build user command 'idea'

idea.ps       description of IDEA (dissertation of Xuejia Lai, chapter 3 only)
byte_ord.ps   description of byte-ordering used for IDEA
idea_cmd.txt  description of user command 'idea'
manl/idea.l   UNIX manual page of user command 'idea' (troff-format of 
              'idea_cmd.txt')

test1         used to check correctness of user command 'idea'.
              output of 'test1' is 'out' and should be identical to 'Examples'.
              type 'make test' to run this test
in            sample input data used by 'test1'
dumphex.c     little program used by 'test1'

INSTALLATION
============

Change the type definitions in 'idea.h' to the representations in your computer
  typedef int            int32;       /* signed 32-bit integer (or larger)   */
  typedef unsigned int   u_int32;     /* unsigned 32-bit integer (or larger) */
  typedef unsigned short u_int16;     /* unsigned 16-bit integer (or larger) */
  typedef char           u_int8;      /* unsigned 8-bit integer              */

Comment this definition 'idea.h' if you have neither a ANSI-C nor a C++ compiler
  #define ANSI_C

Modify 'Makefile' to call your compiler (C, ANSI-C or C++).
  CC = acc

Execute the following commands:
  man -M . idea                       display the man page of idea (UNIX)
  man -t -M . idea                    print the man page of idea (UNIX)
  make                                compile and link the application (general)
